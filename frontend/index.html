                            <h2>Eating shrimp may be healthier than you think</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="https://d2dnvwecfdx5as.cloudfront.net/post_images/55c5a6745012be56cf000142/large.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p> <br><br> <br> If you read our recent investigation, “How Safe is Your Shrimp?” you might be inclined to avoid these crustaceans altogether. Our tests detected bacteria on 60 percent of the 342 raw frozen samples we tested, and traces of illegal antibiotics on 11 of the samples. But if you buy shrimp carefully and handle it properly, it can be a safe and healthy food. And while shrimp’s nutritional reputation has suffered in the past due to its cholesterol profile, it’s actually full of protein as well as certain vitamins and minerals. It also has less mercury than tuna. Here’s the real deal when it comes to eating shrimp, America’s favorite seafood, plus a simple, healthy grilled shrimp recipe from Consumer Report’s test kitchen. <br> Cholesterol <br> Shrimp does have a lot of dietary cholesterol: A 3-ounce serving packs 179 milligrams of it, more than the half of the 300 mg per day that the government has long recommended as the daily maximum. But the government is actually contemplating new recommendations that downplay the dangers of dietary cholesterol, since the newest research suggests that it isn’t strongly linked to the risk of heart attack and stroke. “It’s really saturated fat, not dietary cholesterol that is more strongly linked to cardiovascular risk,” explains Consumer Reports dietitian Amy Keating, R.D. &#160; <br> Fat <br> When it comes to fats, shrimp get high marks for heart-health. A 3-ounce serving contains only trace amounts of saturated and unsaturated fats, compared with 13 grams of fat, 5 of which are saturated, in a typical 3-ounce beef burger. Of course, how you cook your shrimp is important, too. “Avoid pan frying or deep frying your shrimp, which can add fats,” Keating says. “The healthiest option is to grill or steam them.” Another healthy cooking tip: &#34;Try grilling jumbo shrimp in their shells and they will come out moist and flavorful without adding extra fats,” says Claudia Gallo, Consumer Reports in-house chef. <br> Find out if antibiotics in shrimp can spark allergic reactions, which bug repellents really work, and which grills aced our ratings tests.  <br> Calories <br> Shrimp can also be low-calorie, says Keating. That same 3-ounce burger has about 212 calories (bun not included), while a 3-ounce serving of grilled or steamed shrimp tops out at about 100 calories. But avoid battered or deep-fried shrimp, and watch out for high-calorie dips and sauces, too. “They all add calories and fats, minimizing shrimp’s health benefits,” Keating says. <br> Protein <br> Even though shrimp has much less fat and fewer calories than a burger, it has almost as much protein: 19 grams for 3 ounces of shrimp, compared with 22 grams for the burger. <br> Vitamins and minerals <br> Shrimp is also a good source of vitamins B6 and B12. Our bodies need these vitamins to manufacture neurotransmitters, chemicals that help control alertness and mood. They’re also essential for keeping our immune systems strong. And it delivers a host of valuable minerals including, copper, magnesium, phosphorous, selenium, and zinc. <br> Mercury <br> Unlike some other types of seafood, shrimp is low in mercury, which can harm the nervous system of a developing fetus or a young child. This makes it a good choice for women who are pregnant, nursing, or may become pregnant, as well as young children, according to Consumer Reports’ fish experts. <br> —Lauren Cooper  <br> Recipe: Spicy shrimp with mango salsa<br> In less than an hour you can prepare this delicious shrimp dish created by Consumer Reports test kitchen’s in-house chef Claudia Gallo. It’s colorful and healthy. Each portion provides 240 calories, 5 g of fat (almost none of which is saturated), and 25 grams of protein. <br> Placing the shrimp on skewers is a good idea, Gallo says, “It makes it easier to turn them over and provides thorough cooking.” But don’t leave them on the grill too long or they will become dry and tough. “Shrimp only need about two to three minutes of cooking on each side, depending on their size,” Gallo says. <br> Ingredients <br> 1/4 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder <br> 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika <br> 2 teaspoons olive oil <br> 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined (CR recommends U.S. wild or responsibly farmed) <br> 4 lime wedges <br> 1 mango, peeled and finely chopped <br> 1 small red pepper, finely chopped <br> 1 cup fresh corn kernels <br> &#188; cup finely chopped red onion <br> 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice <br> &#188; cup chopped cilantro or mint leaves <br> &#188; teaspoon black pepper <br> Method <br> In a large bowl, mix the salt, spices and olive oil.&#160; Add the shrimp; toss well.&#160; Let marinate while preparing the salsa. <br> In another large bowl, combine the mango, pepper, corn, onion, lime juice, cilantro, and pepper; set aside. <br> Heat the grill to medium-high heat.&#160; Skewer shrimp on metal or bamboo skewers, placing about 4 shrimp on each skewer. (If using bamboo, soak first in water to prevent burning). <br> Grill 1-2 minutes per side until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through.&#160; Serve with mango salsa and lime wedge. <br> Recipe makes 4 servings <br>Consumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this website.

                            <p>These days, the stereotype of \"bad food in Britain\" is woefully dated. Britain has been on the leading edge of the foodie revolution, and I find it's easy to eat very well here. Here are some examples of the foods I've enjoyed in my British travels.    One of the joys of traveling in Britain is enjoying breakfast at each B&#38;B. Your hosts pride themselves on having a long list of classic \"English fry-up breakfast\" elements for their guests to check off: fried toast, blood sausage, porridge, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, baked beans, grapefruit sections, Weetabix, and so on.    For me, one breakfast-time frustration is cold and crunchy toast with butter that's not melted, but scraped across the top. The toast (\"white or granary?\" is the cheery question you get each morning) comes in a rack designed so it gets cold long before it meets your butter.    Pub grub is fun, but after the heavy breakfasts and lots of meat pies and fish-and-chips, finding a restaurant that raises the gastronomic bar is a welcome change. And these days, even the simplest town has a little foodie place where you can get well-presented \"mains\" featuring local and seasonal produce. This delightful plate of Cornish cheese and local fish was good enough to earn this just-opened restaurant a place in the new edition of my guidebook.    One of England's most famous celebrity chefs is Rick Stein. His base is the Cornish fishing port of Padstow, where he runs a cooking school and a variety of Rick Stein restaurants. His flagship restaurant in Padstow is named, simply, Seafood Restaurant. I took time for a drawn-out, three-course lunch here...and loved it. I needed to give this Rick Stein a serious taste, because for the last several years in England, when I mention my book, people say \"Oh, Rick Stein...he's very good.\" Now I better understand who people are confusing me with...and I'm OK with it.    It's fun to be on the road grabbing photos to illustrate points I make in my lectures. For example: \"In the market, characteristic little cafés that cater to local shoppers provide both a great value and a charming memory.\"  &#160; -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

                            <h2>The Inaugural Wild Game Breakfast Sandwich Awards</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="https://d2dnvwecfdx5as.cloudfront.net/post_images/55c4562c8304a67eb4000203/large.jpg" class="img-responsive" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>\n\n        IMG_8385.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Few things are better than a breakfast sandwich—especially when that breakfast sandwich includes wild game. Judging by the @FieldAndStream Instagram feed, more than a few of you agree, because our photos of wild game breakfast sandwiches are among the most popular images we’ve shared. Seriously, more of you have liked and commented on the sandwich shots than you have on photos of guns, bird limits, trophy fish, wild country, or even the endlessly likeable social-media star: dogs. This gave me an idea: These early-bird meals deserve something more than the occasional Instagram post. \n    \nSo, I present the first-ever Wild Game Breakfast Sandwich Awards. Here’s how our awards ceremony will go: In addition to some smaller honors (best cheese, hot sauce, etc.), there are five “major” awards categorized by types of game meat (waterfowl, deer, wild turkey, etc). The winners of these major awards then battled for the grand prize: Breakfast Sandwich of the Year. All nominees were chosen and judged, and the awards decided, by a committee of one: Me. As you can probably tell, more thought (and calories) went into this than I’d care to admit. Then again, breakfast sandwiches deserve to be taken seriously. \n    \nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I need to hit the treadmill.\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        01-IMG_9137.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Major Award: Best Gobbler Breakfast Sandwich\nOur first winner includes a supporting-role ingredient you won’t find in many of the other sandwiches: vegetables. Despite what my wife may tell you, I don’t mind vegetables, but it’s rare that I’ll have something green in the fridge that would work in a breakfast sandwich. On the morning of this meal, however, I sautéed a handful of spinach to add some color and flavor to an amazing mess of an over-easy egg, shredded cheese, hot sauce, and thinly sliced wild turkey breast. The turkey meat came from a hunt in South Dakota this spring, on which I called in (and shot) my first gobbler entirely on my own. I could’ve described every detail of that hunt as I ate this sandwich—and that, I think, cuts right to the best part of cooking and eating wild game: It gives you a chance to relive the hunt. \n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        02-IMG_9810.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Cheese\nI suspect I’ll anger some with this next award, because cheese—particularly when it’s melted—is an ingredient people take seriously and personally. The breakfast sandwiches I’ve cooked over the last several months included cheddar (sliced and shredded), Swiss, pepper Jack, and others.* In the end, though, none came close to American. The flavor is perfect—not too strong, but enough to add something extra—and its “meltability” is unparalleled. The sight alone of an American single drooping until it smothers the meat and eggs in an orange, gooey blanket of processed goodness will never not make me hungry. (No joke: My stomach growled as I finished that sentence.)\n    \n*If you are in the camp that prefers smoked cheese, please stop reading now. Your opinions on breakfast sandwiches don’t deserve to be taken seriously.\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        03-7192_sriracha28oz__05971.1405387798.1280.1280.jpg\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Hot Sauce \nTastes buds were burned. Sinuses were cleared. In the end Sriracha stood out among the rest. To be honest, I kinda hoped “rooster sauce” wouldn’t win because seemed too easy or trendy of a pick, but I can’t help myself. The garlicky, fiery stuff is just too good and it pairs spectacularly with game meat.\n \n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        04_IMG_8614.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Major Award: Best Waterfowl Breakfast Sandwich\nIf this award were really a real award, my speech would go something like this:\nOh, my God. This is so unexpected. I don’t know what to say. [Here’s where I nonchalantly pull a typed speech from my jacket pocket.] First, I’d like to thank all of the other waterfowl breakfast sandwiches that were cooked and consumed. I mean, like, this is such a strong category, you know, especially when you consider that it includes both ducks and geese. To the mallard, black duck, and teal breakfast sandwiches that were up for this award, you’re all an inspiration to me. [Here’s where I pause so you can applaud those losers.] Most of all, I’d like to thank David Draper, without whom I never could have made this snow goose sausage, fried egg, and American cheese sandwich on grilled sourdough bread. [Here’s where I step back from the podium, so y’all can applaud David.] David is a colleague, a talented writer, and a hell of a wild game cook, but he’s also a good friend and the wild game care packages he has sent me over the years are among the most generous gifts I’ve ever received. The very least I can do is try and cook them with the same respect and care that he would. [Here’s where you applaud me. I did just win a major award, after all.]\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        748499928_526607e3ce_o.jpg\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Surprise Ingredient\nI got this idea from Bon Appétit magazine. They included a breakfast sandwich recipe in an issue earlier this year, so naturally I took note. The sandwich was your standard sausage, egg, and cheese—except for one extra ingredient: honey. Any breakfast lover who’s ever dipped a sausage link or bacon strip in some maple syrup knows what a dynamite match that salty-sweet combo is. Well, this is even better. Next time you make a breakfast sandwich at home or at camp, put a bottle of honey on the table right next to the hot sauce. You won’t be disappointed.    \n    \nPhoto courtesy of Andreas Levers/Flickr\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        07-IMG_9153.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Major Award: Best Whitetail Breakfast Sandwich\nIf there’s an icon in the group, here it is: Venison sausage, scrambled eggs, and American, drizzled with hot sauce and honey (see “Best Surprise Ingredient”). I cooked more venison breakfast sandwiches than any other, and this one was my favorite if for no other reason than because it was the most comforting. The venison came from a whitetail I shot in Saskatchewan a couple years ago. That buck scored just south of 150, and as excited as I was about hanging the rack in my office, meals like this one are why I was even more thrilled to be coming home with a duffle bag heavy with frozen meat.\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        08-IMG_9130.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Rip Off of a Fast-Food-Chain Breakfast Sandwich\nI call this one the Hot Thunder Chicken Biscuit. For better or (most certainly) worse, I’m an aficionado of fast-food breakfast sandwiches, and, without question, my favorite is the Cajun Filet Biscuit from Bojangles. Tragically, there are no Bojangles in New York, which may explain why I’ve been known to book flights that connect in Charlotte Douglass International Airport just so I can get Bojangles (Gate B9, in case you’re curious). Since I’m lucky if I fly through that airport once a year, I tried to mimic the recipe with wild game. I fried some South Dakota gobbler breast Nashville style, then placed a hunk between a flaky biscuit. My creation wasn’t quite good as Bojangles—but certainly more convenient. \n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        09-IMG_9317.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Rip Off of a Fine-Dining (Breakfast) Sandwich\nNew York has a restaurant empire that goes by the name Momofuku—Momofuku Ssam Bar, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Momofuku Milk Bar, etc. All of them are excellent, and one of their best-known menu items is the pork bun, which consists of a slab of pork belly, hoisin sauce, cucumbers, and scallions between a steamed bun. It is one of the most delicious things you'll ever eat. Momofuku used to offer a breakfast-sandwich version of the pork bun, which included a fried poached egg. It’s long been off the menu, but I’ve never forgotten that sandwich, and it served as the inspiration for this steamed-bun award winner—duck prosciutto, a fried egg, hoisin sauce, kimchi-style radish and cucumbers, and Sriracha. I cured the duck prosciutto, following this recipe from The Wild Chef cookbook, from the breast of a mallard I shot in New York last November. Honestly, this sandwich was a pain in the ass to make—and a colossal mess to eat—but it was delicious. \n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        5432713686_eb8f0733c1_o.jpg\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Egg Style \nThis was a close one. I love scrambled eggs on a breakfast sandwich. They feel, and taste, substantial (and let’s face it, when you cook a breakfast sandwich, you’re craving a big meal), and scrambled eggs hold up well in a sandwich. That said, the award still goes to the fried egg for one simple reason: the runny yolk. More so than hot sauce, or honey, egg yolk is the official sauce of breakfast sandwiches. When cooked right,* the yolk should spill from the sandwich as soon as you push down on the top layer of bread. Then, after you’ve slice the sandwich in half, you can run it through the oozing gold, bite after bite.\n    \n*If you are in the camp that prefers to fry eggs past the point where the yolks run—to where they’re the consistency of yellow chalk— please stop reading now. You’re almost bad as those in the smoked-cheese camp.\nPhoto courtesy of Shelley Glapion/Flickr\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        10-IMG_8461.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Major Award: Best Upland Breakfast Sandwich\nOnce again, I have Mr. Draper to thank for this winner—pheasant sausage, fried egg, and cheese. He kindly donated the sausage, which was rich, flavorful, and moist—just outstanding overall. I’ll take this moment to briefly talk about frying eggs: Over the course of cooking these sandwiches, I experimented with frying eggs in different fats. I used bacon grease, duck fat, butter, and olive oil. Without question, olive oil was the best. It produces deliciously crisp edges and keeps the egg whites clean and, well, white. Olive oil also allows you to tell yourself that at least something about the sandwich is healthy.\n \n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        11-IMG_9082.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Breakthrough Performance in Breakfast Sandwich Consumption\nThese are the Wild Game Breakfast Sandwich Awards, but one of the most surprisingly flavorful sandwiches I cooked was this one here: fried catfish and a fried egg on an English muffin. I caught the fish in Tennessee with F&amp;S hunting editor, Will Brantley. Fried catfish is one of my all-time favorite foods, so it’s surprising I had leftovers in the first place. But after this sandwich, anytime I fry some for dinner you can bet I’ll save at least one filet, because fried catfish, as it turns out, rivals venison sausage for breakfast.\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        IMG_8385.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Best Bread \nConsidering all but a few of the sandwiches here were stacked between the same kind of bread, you probably saw this winner coming. The award for Best Bread goes to the English Muffin—specifically, Thomas’ brand. The English muffin keeps a breakfast sandwich to the ideal size, and it has the perfect crunch once it’s toasted (and buttered). Grilled sourdough and toasted wheat bread were a close second and third, respectively. \nTo those of you in the South, my apologies, but Bojangles aside, your beloved biscuit is best suited to being spread with butter and jam or smothered with sausage gravy. When used in a breakfast sandwich, a biscuit is a crumbly, dense disaster. Bless your hearts for trying, though.\n \n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        13-IMG_9659.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Major Award: Best Big-Game Breakfast Sandwich\nIt would be criminal to call this a breakfast sandwich. This… This is a breakfast hero: elk backstrap, two fried eggs, three slices of American cheese, and pickled onions on toasted focaccia. The elk was a gift from—you guessed it—David Draper, and I cooked it to medium-rare perfection using the F&amp;S “Redneck Sous Vide” method. (If you haven’t tried that recipe yet, you are missing out big time.) Of all the sandwiches I cooked, this one was definitely the biggest—and yet I’m fairly certain it took me the least amount of time to eat.\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        14-FullSizeRender (15).jpg\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Lifetime Achievement in Breakfast Sandwich Consumption\nBefore we get to the final and most prestigious award, I wanted to pay tribute to the perennial breakfast sandwich MVP—that is, Most Valuable Protein. I am, of course, talking about venison sausage. It hardly matters if your sausage isn’t a “breakfast sausage” blend. The venison sausage mentioned earlier, for example, was kielbasa—and it was awesome for breakfast. I’ve also made a great breakfast sandwich with venison boudin, and I have no doubt the same would be true for venison merguez, chorizo, or bratwurst. My point is: If your freezer contains a stash of whitetail in link or patty form, don’t save it just for dinners or barbecues. Set some in the fridge to thaw before you go to bed, and come morning you’ll be on your way to a day-making breakfast sandwich. \n    \nNow, onto the big award…\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n        07-IMG_9153.JPG\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Breakfast Sandwich of the Year\nHonestly, was there ever any doubt venison sausage, egg, and cheese would win? Just look at this beauty. Ten years from now, when the Wild Game Breakfast Sandwich Awards are televised nationally—complete with a red-carpet special before the ceremony—I expect a gold-dipped replica of this sandwich to be the trophy. We’ll call them The Sammies. \n    \nJust don’t forget to use the #TheSammies hashtag when you follow along on Instagram.\n\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n</p>

                            <h2>8 Things to Know About Madeira Island in Portugal</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="https://d2dnvwecfdx5as.cloudfront.net/post_images/55c30f8efc1458ea670005b0/large.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I visited Madeira island for the first time last year and it was not at all what I expected. I anticipated a touristy beach destination and was so pleasantly surprised to find an island full of culture, amazing hiking possibilities, and delectable gourmet food. Here are eight things I learned about Madeira on my first trip. You'll find even more recommendations for what to do on your trip to Madeira on my Findery notemap.     1. Don't go for the beaches.  Simply put, Madeira island isn't a beach destination. The island might well be 35 miles long and 13 miles wide and boast 99 miles of coastline, but the shore is all rock and cliffs. It's a mountainous island; the highest peak is 1862 meters/6,100 feet high.   Madeira is all mountains, no beaches. Photo by Katja Presnal.  2. It's perfect for adventurous road trips.  Madeira is a great island to rent a car for a day of exploring - or surfing! Head to the north of the island to São Vicente, and visit the 17th century church downtown before heading to the pebble beach, where I hear you can experience some of the best waves of Europe. If surfing isn't for you, just enjoy the scenic cliff views, and visit the São Vicente Caves \"Grutas de São Vicente,\" created by an underground channel of lava from an eruption that occurred about 400,000 years ago.   North Madeira and São Vicente. Photo by Katja Presnal.  3. Ride a cable car up - and a toboggan down.  One of the best ways to see the views of Funchal in Madeira is to hop on the cable car that takes you up to the Botanical Garden or the Monte Palace. Even if you don't want to visit the gardens, the trip is worth it for the views, and you can enjoy the most unique way to come down the hill - the toboggan.    Cable car in Funchal, Madeira. Photo by Katja Presnal.  Take the iconic Monte sledge, a wicker toboggan, down. It has been a popular form of transportation in Monte since 1850. Each toboggan has two sledge drivers called \"Carreiros,\" dressed in a straw hat, white pants, and special shoes that help them keep traction. Their leg muscles, reminiscent of those on soccer players, allow them to run, kick, and steer the large wicker sleighs down the curvy road. Yes, I said curvy. And a little scary. But so much fun!   Toboggan in Monte, Madeira. Photo by Katja Presnal.  4. Climb above clouds.  Climb the mountain top Pico do Arieiro or just take the (tourist) bus up, and soak in the magnificent views of Pico do Arieiro mountain top. You can spend an entire day hiking and get from Pico Arieiro to the highest peak of Madeira to Pico Ruivo. Or you can just go for a day visit to walk among the clouds and enjoy drinks at the mountain top restaurant.   Hiking on Madeira. Photo by Katja Presnal.  5. Don't just drink Madeira wine, sip Poncha.  I knew of Madeira wine, but what I had never heard of before my trip was Poncha. It's an alcoholic drink made with Aguardente de cana (distilled alcohol made from sugar cane juice), honey, sugar, lemon rind, and lemon juice. It is all mixed together in a pitcher with a special Madeiran muddler called a mexelote. The taste is sweet, it doesn't have a strong alcoholic taste, but you might want to sip carefully anyway, packs quite a punch! Where to get it? Almost anywhere, but for the authentic experience, head to Taberna da Poncha, a small pub about a 20-minute-drive from the capital Funchal. The floors are covered with peanut shells, and the walls with business cards left by visitors from around Europe and the rest of the world.   Authentic poncha making on Madeira.

Many of the bananas that grow on the island of Madeira don't grow to EU standards, and so cannot be exported out of Portugal anymore. What is remarkable is that the new regulations from the 1990's didn't kill the banana business of a few hundred years, nor are the islanders all that upset about it (at least not anymore). The islanders believe that \"smaller is better\" and ooze with pride for their bananas. You can't go on a vacation on the island without hearing about their \"small bananas\", which are much sweeter and taste better than the larger ones.   Madeira bananas are small and sweet. Photo by Katja Presnal.  Madeira is not just famous for their small bananas. The farmer's market is full of exotic fruits. One of them is the English tomato, or tamarilho, that typically only grows in high altitudes. It's red and looks like a cross between a plum and a tomato. Another one is a custard apple, an apple-looking fruit that really tastes like a peachy custard. Make sure also to taste the philodendron fruit, a pineapple-looking fruit that tastes like a banana.  7. Madeira is an excellent culinary destination.  The exotic fruits and the availability of amazing seafood makes Madeira an excellent culinary destination. See the local food selection yourself at the Workers' Market, Mercado dos Lavradores. In addition to local produce and fish market, we also saw a shop where a lady was drying Madeira bay leaves, another great Madeiran specialty and an all around great spice to take home. One of the signature dishes on the island is \"espetada\" - meat, bay leaves, and garlic impaled on a stick and grilled to perfection on an open fire. For great espetada, head to Vila da Carne in the village of Camera do Lobos.   Farmer's market in Madeira. Photo by Katja Presnal.  For the best dining experience on the island, go to Cliff Bay Hotel - an excellent resort. Cliff Bay's Il Gallo d'Oro restaurant is Madeira island's only Michelin Star rated restaurant, and their food is an experience not to be missed. No wonder Cliff Bay and Il Gallo d'Oro host the annual Rota das Estrelas, the \"Stars Route,\" gourmet food festival.  8. The best tourist attraction is an irrigation system.  Even if the mountains and seaside cliffs already sold Madeira to you, I still encourage you to visit the levadas. A levada is an irrigation system of the island of Madeira, which is basically a man-made river built on the side of the mountain. It was much more amazing that I ever expected. I am always up for a little hike, however, I am afraid of heights, and was a bit worried about the narrow walkway by the mountain side. I wasn't quite sure if I was fit enough to attempt the adventure.   I'm glad I tried it. The stunning views blew my mind away, the walk was not too hard, and more importantly, the pathway was wider than I thought, and not as steep. With over 1400km/860 miles of the levadas, I am sure there are walks for every skill level, so your experience might be very different depending on the exact location of your hike. We walked good 3 hours, and it was a good workout, but perfectly doable. Truly one of the most unique hikes I have ever done.   Levadas of Madeira. Photo by Katja Presnal.
